Stop joking...
This is the same address with my university!
wait,wait...My mom did tell me there was a high school before.
But that should be 50 years ago.
That's too weird.

Oh, that's a diary of a poor girl.
Is she fine now?

[title=key3found]
That's must be hers. Oh, poor girl.
If this is that high school, why did this school disappear?

[title=key4found]
Oh my god!
That's so crazy! I must find the key and run away.
Now, I can recall how my mother told me.
This school was burned 50 years ago. All people died because nobody can open the emergency exit.
Oh my god. I have to go.
