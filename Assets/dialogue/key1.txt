The first part of diary.
9.23\nIn the first semester of high school, I learned very hard. At the end of this period, I was ranked first in the class. The teacher praised me in class that everyone should learn from me :)
10.12\nAlthough the teacher said that I was a good student, I heard that some of my classmates said I am a submissive puppy at the volume which the teacher cannot hear.
11.2\nToday the teacher asked us to discuss in groups, but no one in the class wanted to be with me. I do not know what I did wrong. I only know that I don't want to go to school :(
11.14\nToday, I found my notes in the toilet, and someone poured juice into my locker. I told the teacher about this, but the teacher said that I was causing confusion of the school.
12.10\nI didn't go to school today. when I thought about school,  it would cause me a stomachache. I felt disappointed and even vomited this morning. Should I visit a doctor?

tutorial3\nFrom now on, each time a player explores a new room, it is possible to appear a ghost (accompanied by the sound of cry) in a random (ghostless) room. \nPlayers can see all the ghosts in the house on the map. When the player enters another room, each ghost will randomly move into others room. If the ghost's new location meets the player, then the player will be scared by the ghost and decrease the SAN value, after that, the ghost will disappear. If the value of the SAN drops to zero, then the player will die and the game will end.
By the way, You can use the R key to rest one round in a room. This means that you do not move anywhere and each ghost still has to move once. This is very helpful when sometimes you inevitably encounter ghosts on a move.
